## Part 1

In order to see changes made to a repository, you want to access the ["Commits"](https://github.com/CapelaGames/pullrequest2024.1/commits/main/) section of github. This shows off all the changes made to the history of the repository.

Another way to view changes specifically done through PRs is to look towards the tab; Pull Requests -> Closed Requests -> Isabelle Changes.
This will take you directly to the changes specified within the PR. This also only includes changes made to the specific branch the PR was initited from.
